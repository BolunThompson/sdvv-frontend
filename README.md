### Introduction

Welcome to the San Diego Voter's Voice Initiative! We are a coalition of non-partisan organizations working together to create a website that will provide transparency for campaign contributions and expenditures with local San Diego candidates.

**Organizations Involved in the Project**

* [Represent.us](https://represent.us/)
* [Common Cause](https://www.commoncause.org/)
* [League of Women's Voters](https://www.lwv.org/)
* [Open San Diego](https://opensandiego.org/)

#### Background Information

Currently, campaign finance information for candidates running for local offices as well as money spent by outside groups to support or defeat them is not readily accessible to the public.  When the amount of money being spent as well as the source is not known, voters feel disenfranchised by the election process.  Making campaign finance data easy to find and read will increase public trust and confidence in the election process.
